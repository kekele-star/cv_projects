# Image Deblurring Using Deep Learning

# Implementatio plan


## Overview
Despite the advancements in high-precision cameras, old family photos of parents, grandparents, and ancestors often suffer from blurriness and degradation due to age. Enhancing image quality by reducing blur and noise is crucial for preserving memories and historical documentation. This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for deblurring old family photos.

## Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Dataset Used:** A Curated List of Image Deblurring Datasets

## Objectives
- Preprocess and prepare the dataset for training.
- Develop a deep learning model using a multi-scale CNN or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for deblurring.
- Implement evaluation metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to assess model performance.
- Optimize the model for fast inference.
- Develop and deploy a user-friendly web application for real-time image deblurring.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Data Preparation and Processing
- Download and explore the dataset.
- Apply necessary pre-processing steps such as normalization and augmentation.

### 2. Model Development
- Choose between a **multi-scale CNN** or **GAN-based approach**.
- Train the model using the prepared dataset.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Utilize evaluation metrics such as:
  - **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**
  - **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Compare the performance of different models.

### 4. Optimization and Deployment
- Optimize the trained model for fast inference speed.
- Develop a web-based interface for real-time image deblurring.
- Deploy the model using frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for model development and data processing)
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for deep learning model training)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit** (for web application development)
- **Docker** (for deployment, if needed)

## Expected Outcome
- A deep learning model capable of effectively reducing image blur.
- A web application where users can upload blurry images and receive enhanced versions.
- Improved skills in handling real-world image degradation problems and applying deep learning solutions.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate more advanced architectures such as Transformer-based models for image enhancement.
- Improve inference time for real-time applications.
- Extend the application to video deblurring.
